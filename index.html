            <h3> Obama Prism yeah</h3>
            <p>The great obama prism is the source of all obama prisms, it emits the obama prisms by shooting them out<br>
    
                It makes obama prisms<br>
                
                Also it rotates very fast (Makes a full rotation every 0.1 seconds or 10 rotations per second)<br>
                
                Nobody is allowed to live here and any organism living on it is to be destroyed<br>
                
                If you were to stand on the great obama prism, you'd be crushed with the force of 500,000x earth surface gravity. </p>
